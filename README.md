# Passenger-traffic-facilitation-Application
The Passenger Facilitation Application is a user-friendly application that aims to streamline the ticketing process for bus travel. Instead of traditional paper tickets or cash transactions, this application utilizes a card-based system where passengers can use coins as currency for their bus fares.
